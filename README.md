It has become a major concern to customers of financial institutions across the country over inadequate practices
while some are lamenting over these practices, others are favoured by their finanacial instutition. This analysis is focused on the review of customers using Natural Launguage Processing (NLP) techniques and classification models. With the recent trend on Twitter, I decided to mine tweets with the keywords *uselss bank, worst bank and bank transaction* using Snscrape. I retrieved over 27,000 unique tweets. some of the libraries are used for this notebook are Pandas (for data manipulation/cleaning/analyzing), Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud (for data visualization), Snsscrape (for tweet mine), NLTK (for applying NLP), TextBlob (for sentiment analysis), Scikit-learn (for modeling). sitback let's enjoy the ride.
